### Hypothesis
We predicted that we could formulate an algorithm that searches through a matrix sorted horizontally and vertically in linear time.

### Background
For an unsorted array, you would do a simple linear search. The worst case for this is O(n^2). When a 1D array is sorted, you can take advantage of the fact that, given an element, all elements before it are less than or equal to the element and all elements after after it are greater than or equal to the element. The 2D array given
